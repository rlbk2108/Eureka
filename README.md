# Getting Started

An LMS is a web application designed to help educational institutions manage online courses and learning activities. The application would typically have features for course management, user management, content management, and communication between instructors and students.

## The application would likely include the following components:

User authentication and authorization: This would involve creating a secure login system for users (students, instructors, and administrators) and setting permissions and roles for each user type.

Course management: This would involve creating, updating, and deleting courses, managing course content (e.g., videos, PDFs, quizzes), setting due dates for assignments, and tracking course progress for students.

User profiles: Each user would have a profile page that displays their personal information, course enrollment status, progress, and grades.


Using Django REST Framework, an LMS application might be designed as a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with a RESTful API backend. The frontend might be built using a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js, while the backend would be built using Django REST Framework.
